Be intentional with what you learn at Turing
Always strive to learn more
never settle always push for something new
New strategies:
  1. Practice google searches for coding related issues each day.
  2. Work on improving, maintaining, and following my calendar to stay more focused on my tasks that need to be completed inside Turing and outside of it.
Shoutout to all of my peers at Turing! I'm a rather introverted person but already speaking with most of y'all during breakout sessions has made it more comfortable for myself to be confident in class!
